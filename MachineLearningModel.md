# Machine Learning Models
A write of at least one machine learning algorithm used on the Titanic data set. Included are the sources for codes, reasoning and paths forward.

## Random Forest Classifier
Supervised learning alogrithm. Used for both classification and regression problems. Reviewing similar Titanic datasets this has promising performance.

Learned about a pandas_profiling after reading other Titanic datasets. It is more robust than df.describe().

### Steps:
 1. Explore the data. See what is available
 2. Look at the baseline model. (Suggested in the Titanic dataset writeups)
 3. Code machine learning algorithms. 

### Output labels

## Decision Tree. 
This is the next suggested learning model to try on the Titianc dataset.
