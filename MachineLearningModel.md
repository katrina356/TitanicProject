# Machine Learning Model

## Machine Learning Model
A write up of at least one machine learning algorithm used on the Titanic data set. Included are the sources for codes, reasoning and paths forward.

## Random Forest Classifier
Supervised learning alogrithm. Used for both classification and regression problems. Reviewing similar Titanic datasets this has promising performance.

Learned about a pandas_profiling after reading other Titanic datasets. It is more robust than df.describe(). Need to install the panadas_profiling package.

### Steps:
1. Explore the data. See what is available.
   a. Install the panadas_profiling package.
3. Look at the baseline model. (Suggested in the Titanic dataset writeups). That baseline is the gender is is .70.
4. Code machine learning algorithms.

### Output labels

#### Source
a. pandas_profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/blob/develop/README.md#command-line-usage

b. machine learning code: https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-use-machine-learning-to-determine-titanic-survivors/

## Decision Tree.
This is the next suggested learning model to try on the Titianc dataset.
