# Machine Learning Modules

* Random Forest Classifier - supervised learning alogrithm. Used for both classification and regression problems. Reviewing similar Titanic datasets this has promising performance.
 Steps:
   1. Use Sklearn for RandomForestClassifier
   2. import cleaned csv
   3. determine importance of columns
   5. create a confusion matrix
   7. Maybe the F-Score
   8. Create plots to show data

Output labels:

* Decision Tree. This is the next suggested learning model to try on the Titianc dataset. 
    Steps:
    1.
