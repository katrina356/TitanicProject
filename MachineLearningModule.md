# Machine Learning Modules

* Random Forest Classifier - supervised learning alogrithm. Used for both classification and regression problems. Reviewing similar Titanic datasets this has promising performance.
   Steps:
    1. Use Sklearn for RandomForestClassifier
    2. determine importance of columns
    3. Do stuff I don't understand
    4. r
    5. create a confusion matrix
    6. Try to understand the confusion matrix
    7. Maybe the F-Score
    8. Create plots for to show data

* Decision Tree. This is the next suggested learning model to try on the Titianc dataset. 
    Steps:
    1.
