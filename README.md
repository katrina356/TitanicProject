![](Resources\Images\R_M_S_Titanic.jpg)

## Presentation

### Logic behind the topic selection:
The Titanic is cool, history cool, and life is too serious… We wanted to do something that we all enjoy learning about. A large enough data set for the project but not too large to manage.

### Data sources:
The initial data sets were selected from two different sources:

[Encyclopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/)

[Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-30-edition/)

We started with six sources of data, analyzed the data and decided which information we need to utilized from which data sets.  This will help us understand whether we need all or only some of the data sets.

### Questions to answer:
1. How do the following impact survival rates:
    * Age
    * Adult vs. Child
    * Ticket Class
    * Passenger vs. Crew
    * By size of thier party traveling
    * By country
    * Gender
    * Embarked
    * By servant vs. employer

2. Average cost of ticket in 2021
    * Cost by class compared to today
3. What was the class fare structure
4. How long did people survive after by class, etc.
