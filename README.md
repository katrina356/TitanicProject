# TitanicProject
Final Project

## Data Analysis and Exploration
The dataset loaded from SQL into the Pandas Jupyter notebook for exploring and machine learning. Researching the Kaggle Titanic dataset led to the pandas_profiling library. This library uses an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide an overview of the variables. It also creates a histogram for each variable - showing its value and how it correlates to other variables. Gender, Class of passenger, ticket fare,age, and family members were used to visualize correlations. 

The Random Forest Classifier is the machine learning algorithm used. Reading numerous Kaggle Titanic dataset articles including one that used and rated 12 maching learning algorithms, the random forest classifier stood out a more accurate algorithm to use plus it was one I felt I could understand.
